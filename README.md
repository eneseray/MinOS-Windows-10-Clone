# MinOS-Windows-10-Clone
Windows 10 Clone using C# Form 👨‍💻

## ℹ️ About The Project

I developed this C# form application in 2017 when I was just 16 years old. That's why there are so many spaghetti codes.
When I first started the software development, I thought that the idea of making such an application would improve me.
It was just as I thought! Thanks to this application, I both grasped the logic of the algorithm and found an internship.
